# pyarrow - let Google Colab manage this version to avoid conflicts with bigframes/gcsfs
# pyarrow<15.0.0a0,>=14.0.1

# Note: The following packages are managed dynamically by module.py:
# - unsloth, trl, transformers, peft, accelerate, bitsandbytes (for Unsloth)
# - llamafactory, llamafactory-cli (for LLaMA-Factory)
# These will be automatically installed/uninstalled as needed when calling functions.
# No need to install them manually or restart runtime when switching between tools.
#
# Note about dependency conflicts:
# Some packages pre-installed in Google Colab (gcsfs, bigframes, numba) may show conflicts
# but these won't affect the core functionality. The versions specified here prioritize
# compatibility with the training and quantization workflows.
